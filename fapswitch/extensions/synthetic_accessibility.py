Synthetic accessibility scoring functions based on:

Estimation of Synthetic Accessibility Score of Drug-like Molecules based on
Molecular Complexity and Fragment Contributions
Peter Ertl and Ansgar Schuffenhauer
Journal of Cheminformatics 1:8 (2009)
doi:10.1186/1758-2946-1-8

several small modifications to the original paper are included
particularly slightly different formula for marocyclic penalty
and taking into account also molecule symmetry (fingerprint density)

This implementation is derived from the RDKit script but has been
adapted for fapswitch.
