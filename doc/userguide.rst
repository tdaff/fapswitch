Source
######

* Obtain a copy of the source code from https://bitbucket.org/tdaff/fapswitch.
  If you do not have access, contact a member of the Woo lab.
* Unpack the source somewhere.
* Add the `bin/` to your path to have access to the scripts for running
  the code.
* Add the root directory to your PYTHONPATH to make the modules importable
  from your own code.


Running on Wooki
----------------

* Use the provided module for fapswitch.
* Run `module avail` to see which versions are available
* Use `module load fapswitch/7.0.0` where 7.0.0 can be any later version
* The module will try and load the modules for RDKit

Running on Sharcnet
-------------------

* The current version is maintained in `tdaff`'s home
* Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:

  .. code-block:: sh

    # for fapswitch
    export PATH=$PATH:/home/tdaff/Compile/fapswitch-7.0/bin
    export PYTHONPATH=/home/tdaff/Compile/fapswitch-7.0:$PYTHONPATH

    # for openbabel/pybel
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/tdaff/work/Software/Python/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tdaff/work/Software/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PATH=/home/tdaff/work/Software/bin:$PATH

    # for RDKit
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tdaff/work/Software/RDKit_2013_09_1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=/home/tdaff/work/Software/RDKit_2013_09_1:$PYTHONPATH
    export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6


Preparing Input Files
---------------------

Fapswitch requires your initial structure as a cif file. To make sure you
have the best functionalisation experience, the following preparations
can help you

* Clean any solvent from the structure, otherwise it will prevent
  functional groups fitting in.
* Remove disorder from the structure. During the functionalisation,
  partially occupied sites all become fully occupied.
* Reduce the atoms in the cif to the asymmetric unit and make sure that
  all the symmetry operations are provided.
* If no connectivity information is provided in the CIF, use the `openbabel`
  connectivity option and the structure will be passed to openbabel for bond
  and atom type perception. If you have a periodic system you will need
  to use a periodic version of openbabel. Always check that the final bonding
  and types make sense!
* (*Preferred*) Add bonding information to the cif:

  * CIFs exported from Materials Studio with the correct bonding will have
    the bonding in the correct format for fapswitch.
  * To utilise the bonding information use `bondsonly` option for connectivity
    and atom typing will be derived from the provided bonds.
  * To manually add the bonding, it is contained within a `loop_` that defines
    atoms in the bond by their atom labels, optionally their distance, and
    the bond type (S=single, D=double, T=Triple, A=Aromatic)::

       loop_
       _geom_bond_atom_site_label_1
       _geom_bond_atom_site_label_2
       _geom_bond_distance
       _ccdc_geom_bond_type
       C1 C2 1.1021 A

* (Optionally) Add atom typing information to the cif:

  * Put the atom type in the `_atom_site_description` field.
  * Assign atom types based on the UFF to work with the atom types on the
    functional groups.
  * To utilise the typing information use `file` option for connectivity
    and no bond perception will be carried out.
  * These get passed through to the output file.
  * Must be added manually::

      loop_
      _atom_site_label
      _atom_site_type_symbol
      _atom_site_description
      _atom_site_fract_x
      _atom_site_fract_y
      _atom_site_fract_z
      C1    C     C_R   0.943990 0.413360 0.732350
      C2    C     C_R   0.681010 0.211640 0.267650

Options
-------

All of the fapswitch codes use a unified options and command scheme. Options
are set as simple "option = value". In some cases the value can be a list of
values, for which punctuation is ignored, so that any whitespace, comma or
brackets can be used to separate items. Boolean options accept, "true", "yes",
"on", "1" for positive responses (case insensitive). Options
specified are used in ascending priority as listed below:

* (lowest priority) **defaults** are set for all options. These are shown below
  or can be found in the file `fapswitch/config/defaults.fap`
* **job types** are specified through the commandline. When running the
  command use the `-j` option to specify job types and the code will search
  the user's ~/.faps folder for the corresponding job.fap files, for example:

    cliswitch.py -j basic -j just_halogen job_name

  will read the options from `~/.faps/basic.fap`, followed by
  `~/.faps/just_halogen.fap`
* **job specific** options are read from `job_name.fap` in the working
  directory.
* (highest priority) **commandline** options are specified with
  `-o option=value` and take priority over all other options.

.. _naming-and-custom-string-syntax:

Naming and custom string syntax
-------------------------------

  * Square brackets, ``[]``, are used to denote structures with symmetry.

     * Naming is ``functional_group_short_code@symmetry_site_identifier``.
     * Groups are separated by a full stop, ``.``
     * ``[Me@H1.Ph@H4]`` represents a methyl attached to site ``H1`` and a
       phenyl attached to ``H4``.
     * Exact rotations of the functional groups and disorder may be denoted
       by adding a ``%`` symbol:

        * ``a`` to ``z`` are rotation angles from 0 to 346 in 14 degree
          increments.
        * A ``+`` symbol is used to request the smallest angle for which the
          functional group will fit.
        * A ``_`` symbol denotes an unfunctionalised site.
        * A single character applies the rotation to all.
        * Rotations for all sites for that group must be specified if not
          applying a single rotation to all groups.
        * ``[Ph@H4%e]`` represents a phenyl attached to ``H4`` with all groups
          rotated 55 degrees
        * ``[Ph@H4%aeae__ae]`` represents six phenyls attached to ``H4`` with
          alternating rotations of 0 and 55 degrees, with two sites left
          unfunctionalised.
        * ``[Ph@H4%a_a_+_+_]`` represents four a phenyls attached to ``H4`` with
          two sites fixed at rotations of 0 degrees and the smallest rotation
          of the other sites determined by fapswitch. Four sites are left
          unfunctionalised.

     * File names include the functionalisation string (without the brackets).

  * Curly brackets, ``{}``, denote non symmetric functionalisation.

      * The functional group at each site is named in turn by the short code,
        separated by full stops.
      * Unfunctionalised sites are left empty.
      * Any remaining sites by the end of the string are left empty.
      * ``{..Me..Me..Me}`` will place a methyl on the 3rd, 5th and 7th sites,
        all other sites (including past the 7th) are left unfunctionalised.
      * To deal with long file names, the string of functional groups is
        converted to a hash: ``hashlib.md5(str(functions)).hexdigest()``.



Running the code (typical uses)
-------------------------------

For a typical job, you would set the required options in the configuration
files and run `cliswitch.py job_name` to generate functionalised structures.

Make all functional derivatives
===============================

This will generate all combinations of all groups on all functional sites. For
many sites and many groups, this will take a long time.

.. code-block:: ini

   # mof.fap
   replace_all_sites = True

Run ``cliswitch.py mof`` to generate all the structures.


Make limited functional derivatives
===================================

You can limit which functional groups and sites to include in the complete
functionalisation procedure.

.. code-block:: ini

   # mof.fap
   replace_all_sites = True
   replace_groups = Me Ph Cl NH2 COOH
   replace_only = H2 H4 H5
   max_different = 2

Run ``cliswitch.py mof`` to generate all combinations of the five selected
groups on the three functionalisation sites using no more than two different
functional groups at any time.


Make random functional derivatives
==================================

The procedure can be completely randomised, generating members from the
complete set of all possible functionalisations.

.. code-block:: ini

   # mof.fap
   site_random_count = 10
   full_random_count = 5
   replace_groups = Me Ph Cl NH2 COOH
   replace_only = H2 H4 H5
   max_different = 2

Run ``cliswitch.py mof`` to generate ten random site symmetric structures using
the set functional groups and sites. Also generate five structures that ignore
symmetry completely.


Make specific structures
========================

Using the ``custom_string`` syntax (:ref:`naming-and-custom-string-syntax`) it
is possible to generate specific structures.

.. code-block:: ini

   # mof.fap
   custom_strings =
       [Ph@H4]
       [Cl@H1.Me@H4]
       {Ph..Ph.Ph..Me...Me....Me}
       [COOH@H2%aaaa____mmmm]


Running ``cliswitch.py mof`` will generate two structures with
set functional groups on specific symmetric sites. A third structure has
groups attached to individual, non-symmetric sites. The final structure


Daemon mode
===========

Fapswitch can run in a client-server mode using ``fapswichd.py`` instead of
the ``cliswitch.py``. Start the daemon using the same options. It is possible
to specify a port to listen on in the options too. The daemon listens for a
``custom_string`` which it will create in the current directory.

See ``tools/socket_client.py`` for how to communicate with the daemon.


Web interface
=============

The web interface is currently for demonstration mode only.
