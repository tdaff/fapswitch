Functional Groups
=================

Fapswitch is distributed with a selection of functional groups. A 
number of groups were used to parameterise the MEPO charge equilibration
method, and the rest have been tested for compatibility with those
parameters. The tools directory includes scripts to regenerate the 
library and a script to generate custom groups called 
``align_functional_groups.py``, which requires a fairly recent version 
of openbabel to access all the feature.

The full list of groups with all, details can be found at 
`Functional Groups <_static/functional_groups.html>`_. ``list_groups.py`` 
also outputs details of the functional groups to the terminal and log 
files and will show more information with higher verbosity, ``-v``.groups.
