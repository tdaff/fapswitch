Fapswitch
=========

Fapswitch is a program to systematically functionalise structures.

In the field of nanoporous materials, many applications, such as gas
capture and storage require structures with specific pore shapes and
chemistries. In several cases, simple functional group modification
has resulted in massive improvements in the performance of framework
materials. By systematically exchanging functional groups in known
materials we can generate vast numbers of hypothetical materials to
test for improved performance.

In a typical use-case we would take the structure of a know material
and use fapswitch to generate an array of functional derivatives.
