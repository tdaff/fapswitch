Functional group switching procedure targeted at hypothetical MOF
generation from high symmetry cif files.

The purpose of the code is to take highly symmetric structures from cif files
and modify the functional groups to produce structures for high throughput
screening.

A manuscript is in prepartion for the method, however the application of
functional group modification of MOFs is well demonstrated in the paper:

A demo is available at https://fapswitch.herokuapp.com/.

This code was produced for the Woo Lab http://titan.chem.uottawa.ca/. For
develpoment updates and applications please contact a member of the lab.
