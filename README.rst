Fapswitch
---------

Functional group switching procedure targeted at hypothetical MOF
generation from high symmetry cif files.

The purpose of the code is to take highly symmetric structures from cif files
and modify the functional groups to produce structures for high throughput
screening. This code is produced by the Woo Lab http://titan.chem.uottawa.ca/.

The code is stored privately at bitbucket and is made available as
downloads. Full mercurial access is only available to developers.

For bugs and feature requests, use the Bitbucket tracker.
